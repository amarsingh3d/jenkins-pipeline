# Continues Deployment for Docker Image, Build and push Docker image to Docker hub using Jenkins Pipeline
**Jenkins Pipeline:**

Jenkins Pipeline uses a build pipeline plugin which supports continues delivery pipeline into Jenkins.
A continuous delivery (CD) pipeline is an automated expression of your process for getting software from version control right through to your users and customers.
The definition of a Jenkins Pipeline is written into a text file (called a Jenkinsfile) which in turn can be committed to a projectâ€™s source control repository.

After adding credentials. 
In the Jenkinsfile, I have defined steps to stop and delete existing container so we need to run following command before continuing. Open Docker quick terminal and the command.

```
$ docker run -dit --name apache2 -p 80:80 ubuntu
```
The above command will create a container of ubuntu with name apache2. Let's continue.
